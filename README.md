# Burger: Node Express Handlebars

## Description

This application is a burger logger that lets users input the names of burgers of what they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. This application uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
